## Description
This is a web implementation of the popular 2048 game, built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game is a single-player sliding block puzzle game in which the player must combine tiles with the same number to create a tile with the sum of the two numbers. The game ends when the board is filled with tiles and no more moves are possible.
## How to Play
Use the arrow keys(or "WASD") to slide the tiles in the direction of your choice. Tiles with the same number will merge into one when they touch. Each move adds a new tile to the board with a value of either 2 or 4. The goal is to reach the 2048 tile.
## Popular Tactic: The Corner Strategy
The most popular tactic in 2048 is the Corner Strategy. This involves focusing on one corner of the board and keeping the highest value tile in that corner. By doing this, you limit the number of moves you need to make and increase the chance of merging tiles with the same value. The other three corners can be used to temporarily store tiles and make room for new ones to appear. However, be careful not to get stuck in one corner or you may run out of moves!
